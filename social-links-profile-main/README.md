## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I challenged myself to create a useful project in under two hours and I accomplished that. I customized the project to my own needs while maintaining the original design as much as possible without the use of a Figma file. I learned how to use semantic HTML, especially in the use of creating an unordered list with anchor tags inside of list items to maintain accessibility and element heirarchy. I had to figure out how to remove the default padding on the left of list items, as well as styling the anchor tag and not the list item itself in order to click the entire container and not just the text.

### Continued development

I enjoy my mobile first workflow I've utilized in this project. I would like to utilize a Figma file for a more precise user interface. I would also like to develop multiple CSS themes, including a light and dark mode for this. I plan to use this project as an actual social link page, so tailoring it more carefully for that will be my plan.
